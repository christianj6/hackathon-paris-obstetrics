# F'AI'R Hackathon

Improving midwife education via obstetrics e-learning content recommender system.

---

### Overview

This repository hosts code for a web application submitted as part of the [F'AI'R Hackathon](https://www.x5gon.org/2020/day-2-the-x5gon-hackathon-winners/) supported by the X5GON API. The hackathon challenge was to develop an e-learning intervention which supported the [UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.unesco.org/sustainabledevelopmentgoals). Our proposed intervention is a web application for navigating a small corpus of obstetric training resources. The application recommends articles using on a skill-based user proficiency model and document embeddings, which is designed as a learning support for midwife training in areas with underdeveloped educational programs. The application also incorporates light social-networking functionality which allows two users to pair as 'buddies' and share helpful content with each other via a Pinterest style board. 

### Application
